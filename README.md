## Setup

- Drop the mod in the mods folder

## Details

Changes the textures used for Enderchests and trapped chests at Christmas as vanilla uses the same texture.

My textures are probably trash but I'm a programmer not an artist.

You can change when Christmas chests appear (from v1.0.1 onward):

- Always
- Only at Christmas
- Never
